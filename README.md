This is the outdated version, see the updated one [here](https://github.com/Sydney-Randall/Intuitive-Visualization-Rebuild)  
This is left up so that anyone can see the difference between the Quickstart version and the one generated with Angular-CLI. There is no documentation here, however much of it is the same as the updated version at the point it was left off.
